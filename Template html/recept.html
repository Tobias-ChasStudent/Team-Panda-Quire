    <h1>Andalusian Gazpacho Recipe</h1>
    
    <h3>Note: Use only the ripest tomatoes. Don't use a bread that's too flavorful (no sourdough, for example) or rough.
        You want it to soften and blend into the soup completely. You can serve the soup as is with a drizzle of olive oil,
        sherry vinegar, and a sprinkle of chives and ground black pepper, or you can add a few diced vegetables back to the
        smooth base for texture.</h3>
